# MC Mod Updater
Console based application that can update your minecraft mods.

TODO:
- Make it easier to use for people that struggle with console based apps
- Add option for 'mods.txt' presets
- Add mods folder scanning instead of putting URLs in a txt file
- Add GUI

# Installation
For Windows, go to the [releases](https://github.com/AidenRaaphorst/mc-mod-updater/releases) and download the exe file.  
For Linux and macOS, download the source code and run `main.py`.

The first time you use the app, it will ask for a CurseForge API key.  
To get one, visit https://console.curseforge.com/, login or make an account, 
click on the tab called 'API keys' and copy the key.
